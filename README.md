# Specifications

The subject of the project consists in the photorealistic presentation of 3D objects using OpenGL library. The user directly manipulates by mouse and keyboard inputs the scene of objects.
For this purpose, an ancient scene was created where the user can interact with the camera, move around the town, day-night cycle and many more functionalities.

# Scenario
## Scene and objects description

The scene is composed of a town with buildings, a town obelisk square, a statue plazza, some stalls, street lights and city walls. In order to make the city "alive", the environment depicts a quent ancient/medieval city with ambiental city sounds, water splashing sound effects and merchants sounds around the stalls.
The town has the following elements:
* City Walls
* City Gate Walls
* Streets
* Street Lamps with dynamic lighting
* A monument at the center of it
* A city forum where the people of the city could meet and trade
* Merchant stalls
* Grass
* Skybox
This elements were combined in order to produce the following demo images:
* Map view of the city
